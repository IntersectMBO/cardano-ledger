# Summary

Lots of work on the chain spec this week, as well as generators for delegation.

# Remarks

- Started work on two integrations - with cardano-shell, on bulk chain validation, and with the consensus layer.
- Starting with consensus layer intergration in particular has resulted in some revisions to the specs in order to line up.
- Next week we intend to start merging the specifications with the Shelley era specs.
