On the most basic level what we are after is a first order representation of
typed functions. Furthermore, we need the representation to be compositional so
that you can plug-in your own functions into the universe.

That might sound like it's no problem, but the issue is with higher-order
functions. Consider:

data ListFn where
  MapFn :: _ '[a] b -> ListFn '[[a]] [b]

What should go in place of `_`? It turns out that you need to specify the global
function universe and make sure the global universe is the same everywhere.

data ListFn fn where
  MapFn :: fn '[a] b -> ListFn fn '[[a]] [b]

--   Luckily we can get conjuction by using Preds, in fact using Preds, the x and y
--   can even be the same variable.
--   Or can be problematic too (by using a form of DeMorgan's laws: x && y = not(not x || not y))
--   but while that is possible, there are many scenarios which can only be specified using Or.
--   If one inadvertantly uses a form of DeMorgan's laws, the worst that can happen is an ErrorSpec
--   is returned, and the user can reformulate using Preds. So Or is incomplete, but sound, when it works.
