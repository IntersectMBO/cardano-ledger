{-
On the most basic level what we are after is a first order representation of
typed functions. Furthermore, we need the representation to be compositional so
that you can plug-in your own functions into the universe.

That might sound like it's no problem, but the issue is with higher-order
functions. Consider:

data ListFn where
  MapFn :: _ '[a] b -> ListFn '[[a]] [b]

What should go in place of `_`? It turns out that you need to specify the global
function universe and make sure the global universe is the same everywhere.

data ListFn fn where
  MapFn :: fn '[a] b -> ListFn fn '[[a]] [b]
