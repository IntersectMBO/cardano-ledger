-- | This module implementes this very neat little trick for observing when
-- type families are stuck https://blog.csongor.co.uk/report-stuck-families/
-- which allows us to report much better type errors when our generics tricks
-- fail.
module Constrained.TypeErrors (

import Data.Kind

-- | The idea of this type family is that if `ty` evaluates to a type (other than Dummy which
-- we haven't exported) then `Computes ty (TE err)` will evaluate to `()` without
-- getting stuck and without expanding `TE` to `TypeError err`.
--
-- If, on the other hand, GHC gets stuck evaluating `ty` it will (hopefully) try to normalize
-- everything and (hopefully) end up with `Computes (TypeError err) ty` which in turn will cause
-- it to throw `err` as a type error.
--
-- Now, the important thing here is that you can't do `Computes _ _ = ()` because that doesn't
-- force the evaluation of `ty` and consequently doesn't end up with GHC wanting to report
-- that `Computes tyThatDoesntCompute (TE err)` fails and consequently normalizing `TE err`
-- and finally arriving at `TypeError err`.
