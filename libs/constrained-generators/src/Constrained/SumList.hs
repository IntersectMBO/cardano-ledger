-- | Operations for generating random elements of Num like types, that sum to a particular total.
--   The class `Foldy` (defined in the TheKnot.hs) gives the operations necessary to do this.
--   In this module we define the helper functions necessary to define the methods of the Foldy class.
--   The helper functions do not need to know about the Foldy class, and are not dependent upon any of
--   the mutually recursive operations defined in TheKnot, except the operations defined in the Complete class.
--   That class is defined in this module, but the instance for that class is made in TheKnot.
