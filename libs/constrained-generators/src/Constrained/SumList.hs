-- | The basic idea is to concat all the Yes's and skip over the No's.
--   The one wrinkle is if everything is No, then in that case return an arbitrary one of the No's.
--   This can be done in linear time in the length of the list. Call that length n.
--   Check for all No. This takes time proportional to n. If it is true return one of them.
--   If it is not all No, then concat all the Yes, and skip all the No.
--   We find the first No (if it exist), and all the Yes by partitioning the list
--   This is similar in spirit to Constrained.GenT.catGEs, but doesn't require a
--   a Monad to escape on the first No.
