-- | Data.Coders provides tools for writing 'EncCBOR' and 'DecCBOR' instances (see module
--   'Cardano.Binary') in an intuitive way that mirrors the way one constructs values of a
--   particular type. Advantages include:
--
-- 1. Book-keeping details neccesary to write correct instances are hidden from the user.
-- 2. Inverse 'EncCBOR' and 'DecCBOR' instances have visually similar definitions.
-- 3. Advanced instances involving sparse-encoding, compact-representation, and 'Annotator' instances are also supported.

-- ====================================================================

-- ===============================================================================
-- Encode and Decode are typed data structures which specify encoders and decoders
-- for Algebraic data structures written in Haskell. They exploit types and count
-- the correct number fields in an encoding and decoding, which are automatically computed.
-- They are somewhat dual, and are designed so that visual inspection of a Encode and
-- its dual Decode can help the user conclude that the two are self-consistent.
-- They are also reusable abstractions that can be defined once, and then used many places.
--
-- (Encode t) is a data structure from which 3 things can be recovered
-- Given:    x :: Encode t
-- 1. get a value of type t
-- 2. get an Encoding for that value, which correctly encodes the number of "fields"
--    written to the ByteString. Care must still be taken that the Keys are correct.
-- 3. get a (MemoBytes t)
--
-- The advantage of using Encode with a MemoBytes, is we don't have to make a EncCBOR
-- instance. Instead the "instance" is spread amongst the pattern constuctors by using
-- (memoBytes encoding) in the where clause of the pattern contructor.
-- See some examples of this see the file Timelocks.hs

-- Encoders

-- | A first-order domain specific langage for describing EncCBOR instances. Applying
--   the interpreter 'encode' to a well-typed @(Encode w T)@ always produces a valid encoding for @T@.
--   Constructing an Encode of type T is just like building a value of type T, applying a constructor
--   of @T@ to the correctly typed arguments. For example
--
-- @
-- data T = T Bool Word
--
-- instance EncCBOR T where
--   encCBOR (T b w) = encode (Rec T !> To b !> To w)
-- @
--
-- Note the similarity of
--
-- @(/T/ /b/ /w/)@ and @(/T/ $ /b/ $ /w/)@ and @(Rec /T/ !> To /b/ !> To /w/)@
--
-- Where ('!>') is the infx version of 'ApplyE' with the same infixity and precedence as ('$'). Note
-- how the constructor and each (component, field, argument) is labeled with one of the constructors
-- of 'Encode', and are combined with the application operator ('!>'). Using different constructors supports
-- different styles of encoding.
