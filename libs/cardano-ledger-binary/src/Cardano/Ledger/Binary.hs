-- | Translation function between values through a related binary representation. This
-- function allows you to translate one type into another (or the same one) through their
-- common binary format. It is possible for the source type to be encoded with a different
-- version than the version that will be used for decoding. This is useful for types that
-- build upon one another and are "upgradeable" through their binary representation. It is
-- important to note that the deserialization will happen with `Annotator`, since that is
-- usually the way we deserialize upgradeable types that live on chain. Moreover, encoding
-- does not require a version, because memoized types that were decoded with annotation
-- will have the bytes retained and thus will have the `ToCBOR` instance.
