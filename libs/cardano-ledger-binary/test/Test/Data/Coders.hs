-- There are two ways to write smart encoders and decoders that don't put
-- fields with default values in the Encoding, and that reconstruct them
-- on the decoding side. These techniques work on record datatypes, i.e.
-- those with only one constructor. We will illustrate the two approaches
-- in the datatype A

-- The virtual constructor stategy pretends there are mutiple constructors
-- Even though there is only one. We use invariants about the data to avoid
-- encoding some of the values.

-- ================================================================================
-- The Sparse encoding strategy uses N keys, one for each field that is not defaulted
-- encode (baz (M 9 [True] (pack "hi"))) --Here No fields are defaulted, should be 3 keys
-- [TkMapLen 3,TkInt 0,TkInt 9,TkInt 1,TkListBegin,TkBool True,TkBreak,TkInt 2,TkString "hi"]
--                   ^key            ^key                                    ^key
-- So the user supplies a function, that encodes every field, each field must use a unique
-- key, and fields with default values have Omit wrapped around the Key encoding.
-- The user must ensure that there is NOT an Omit on a required field. 'baz' is an example.

baz :: M -> Encode ('Closed 'Sparse) M
baz (M n xs t) = Keyed M !> Omit (== 0) (Key 0 (To n)) !> Omit null (Key 1 (To xs)) !> Key 2 (To t)

-- To write an Decoder we must pair a decoder for each field, with a function that updates only
-- that field. We use the Field GADT to construct these pairs, and we must write a function, that
-- for each field tag, picks out the correct pair. If the Encode and Decode don't agree on how the
-- tags correspond to a particular field, things will fail.

boxM :: Word -> Field M
boxM 0 = field update0 From
  where

-- Finally there is a new constructor for Decode, called SparseKeyed, that decodes field
-- keyed sparse objects. The user supplies an initial value and pick function, and a list
-- of tags of the required fields. The initial value should have default values and
-- any well type value in required fields. If the encode function (baz above) is
-- encoded properly the required fields in the initial value should always be over
-- overwritten. If it is not written properly, or a bad encoding comes from somewhere
-- else, the intial values in the required fields might survive decoding. The list
-- of required fields is checked.
