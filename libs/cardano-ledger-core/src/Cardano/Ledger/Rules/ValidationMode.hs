-- | Describes modes under which we might validate certain rules in the ledger.

--   What does this mean? Sometimes, we will want to check only certain
--   conditions specified in the rules. For example, when replaying a previously
--   validated chain, we do not care about rerunning _any_ checks, only making
--   the relevant changes to the ledger state.

-- $static
--
-- Static checks are used to indicate that a particular predicate depends only
-- on the signal to the transition, rather than the state or environment. This
-- is particularly relevant where the signal is something such as a transaction,
-- which is fixed, whereas the state and environment depend upon the chain tip
-- upon which we are trying to build a block.

-- | Indicates that this check depends only upon the signal to the transition,
-- not the state or environment.
