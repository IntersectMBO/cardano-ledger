-- Algorithm for computing the DRep stake distrubution

-- | Given three inputs
--   1) Map (Credential 'Staking c) (DRep c).   The delegation map. Inside the DRepUView of the UMap 'um' from the DState.
--   2) regDreps :: Map (Credential 'DRepRole c) (DRepState c). The map of registered DReps to their state. The first part of the VState.
--   3) stakeDistr :: VMap VB VP (Credential 'Staking c) (CompactForm Coin). The aggregated state distr. The first part of the Mark SnapShot.
--   Compute the Drep distribution of stake(Coin)
--  cost is expected to be O(size of 'stakeDistr' * log (size of 'um') * log (size of 'regDreps'))
--  This is going to be expensive, so we will want to pulse it. Without pulsing, we estimate 3-5 seconds

--   If so then add that coin to the aggregated map 'ans', mapping DReps to compact Coin

--   that the credential is a member of the registered DRep map ('regDreps') before adding it to 'ans'

--   'accumDRepDistr' will be partially applied to the components of type (UMap c)

--   equality (~) constraints to fix both the monad 'm' and the 'ans' type, to
--   the context where we will use the type as a Pulser. The type DRepPulser must
--   have 'm' and 'ans' as its last two parameters so we can make a Pulsable instance.
--   We will always use this instantiation (DRepPulser c Identity (Map (DRep c) (CompactForm Coin)))
