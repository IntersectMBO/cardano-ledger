-- ================= The Iter class =================================================

-- | The Set algebra include types that encode finite sets and maps of some type. They
-- have a finite domain, and for each domain element they pair a single range
-- element (unit for sets). We are interested in those finite maps that can iterate their
-- pairs in ascending domain order. The operations are: `nxt` and `lub` .
-- lub can skip over many items in sub-linear time, it can make things really fast.
-- Many finite maps can support a support lub operation in sub-linear time. Some examples:
-- Balanced binary trees, Arrays (using binary search), Tries, etc. There are basic and compound
-- Iter instances. Compound types include components with types that have Iter instances.
class Iter f where
  nxt :: f a b -> Collect (a, b, f a b)
  lub :: Ord k => k -> f k b -> Collect (k, b, f k b)

  -- | The next few methods can all be defined via nxt and lub, but for base types there often exist
  -- much more efficent means, so the default definitions should be overwritten for such basic types.
  -- For compound types with Guards, these are often the only way to define them.
  hasNxt :: f a b -> Maybe (a, b, f a b)
  hasNxt f = hasElem (nxt f)

  hasLub :: Ord k => k -> f k b -> Maybe (k, b, f k b)
  hasLub a f = hasElem (lub a f)
  haskey :: Ord key => key -> f key b -> Bool
  haskey k x = case hasLub k x of Nothing -> False; Just (key, _, _) -> k == key

-- | In order to build typed 'Exp' (which are a typed deep embedding) of map and set operations, we need to know
-- what kind of basic types can be used this way. Every Basic type has a few operations
-- for creating one from a list, for adding and removing key-value pairs, looking up a value given a key.
-- Instances of this algebra are functional in that every key has exactly one value associated with it.

-- | BaseRep witnesses Basic types. I.e. those types that are instances of both Basic and Iter.
