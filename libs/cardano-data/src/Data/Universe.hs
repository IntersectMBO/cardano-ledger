-- | The idea is to create a world of Haskell types, called a Universe. Then to
--   define a 'class' whose methods are only applicable to that set of types. We define
--   a closed set by defining an indexed type constructor Rep. If (Singleton Rep), then it must
--   be that every value of type (Rep t) has exactly 0 or 1 inhabitants. (Rep t) has exactly
--   1 inhabitant if 't' is in the universe, and 0 inhabitants if it is not in the universe.
--   A closely related class is (Indexed s t). We would like a total ordering on (t i) and (t j),
--   where the indices, i and j, are different. We do this by ensuring every value of type (t i)
--   has a unique Shape, and that the type Shape has a total order. Every closed singleton can
--   be totally ordered this way. Other indexed type are used to make well type terms. I.e.
--   Indexed s t => Exp t, denotes a Haskell data type Exp, related to the type t.
--   Note, unlike singletons, there may not be a unique value of type (Exp t), but there may be
--   a unique Shape for every value.

-- | Given (Singleton T), a value of type (T i) has exactly 0 or 1 inhabitants,
--   so we can compare the structure of the type to get proofs that the indexes (i and j)
--   are the same type, using testEql, at runtime. 'cmpIndex', it is like 'compare'
--   except we can have two different indexes ('a' and 'b').

-- | For some indexed types, we can assign a unique Shape to each type,
--   using: 'shape' :: t i -> Shape s   (where s is some Singleton type)
--   the class (Shaped t s) means we can assign a unique Shape to each
--   value of type (t i). Not quite as strong as having a unique inhabitant.
--   Every closed singleton type can be shaped, and many other indexed types
--   can be shaped as well.

-- | Order two indexed types by their Shape. This is usefull for making (Singleton t)

-- We assign this unique Shape using :  shape:: R t -> Shape x.

-- A strategy for defining Eq and Ord instances for (Any t) if it is Shaped
-- We don't actually make these instances, because there are other strategies
-- we don't want to preclude. But just replace 't' with an indexed type 'R'
