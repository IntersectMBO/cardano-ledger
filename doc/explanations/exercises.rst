=======================
Native tokens exercises
=======================

Prerequisites
=============

1. You should be familiar with setting up and operating a Cardano node.
2. Read the explainer about multi-asset tokens, documentation on how to
   work with the Cardano node, and operations with multi-asset tokens in
   the sections above.
3. Checkout and build the ``github`` sources for the ``cardano-node``
   that have been tagged with ``mary``.
4. Start a Cardano node that you can submit commands to.

Objectives
==========

This set of exercises is aimed to ensure that you can:

1. Manage existing native tokens;
2. Create new native tokens;
3. Submit transactions that include native tokens on the Cardano
   blockchain.

Please report any bugs or improvements through the ``cardano-node``
github repository.

Exercises
=========

1. Create a set of private/public signing keys, *shelley*, and three
   *addresses* *(ada, mary and percy)*. Fund *ada* from the *faucet*.
   Request some **Wollstonecraft** tokens from the token owner to fund
   your *mary* address. Verify that both addresses have the expected
   values. What do you observe about the *mary* values?
2. Send 100 **ada** from *ada* to *mary*, and 10 **Wollstonecraft** from
   *mary* to *percy*. Check the values of all three addresses before and
   after the transactions.
3. Define a *minting policy script* for the **KingOfKings** currency
   that allows *shelley* to create new **Ozymandian** tokens.
4. Mint 1000 new **Ozymandians** in the *percy* address. Check that they
   have been successfully minted. Note that you might need to fund the
   *percy* address with additional **ada**.
5. What is the least amount of **ada** that you need to keep in each of
   your addresses? What is the least amount of **Ozymandians** or
   **Wollstonecraft** that you can keep in an address?
6. You want to *redeem* some of your **Wollstonecraft** tokens. How do
   you do this? Similarly, how do you redeem your **Ozymandians**? What
   happens to your **ada** balances when you redeem your tokens?
7. Create a new *minting policy script* that allows *shelley* to create
   **Wollstonecraft**, **ada** and **Ozymandian** tokens. Mint new
   tokens of each type and send them to *mary* and *percy*. Check that
   they have been successfully received. What do you observe about the
   balances on each of the addresses?
8. Create five new signing addresses: *athena*, *zeus*, *hera*,
   *poseidon* and *dionysus*. Create a *minting policy script* that
   allows any majority of the five Olympians to mint **Platinum**,
   **Gold**, **Silver** and **Bronze** medals. Send *percy* one new
   **Gold** medal, and send *mary* one new **Platinum** medal, two
   **Gold** medals, and four **Silver** medals. Check the balances for
   each of your addresses. Now transfer one **Gold** medal and one
   **Silver** medal from *mary* to *percy* and check the balances again.

**Optional exercises**

9. Set up a number of “mints” that each produce coins of a specific
   type. The values of each of the coins is given below.

======== ========================
Coin     Value
======== ========================
Pound    20 shillings
Merk     13 shillings and 4 pence
Noble    6 shillings and 8 pence
Shilling 12 pence
Bawbee   6 pence
Groat    4 pence
Penny    1 pence
======== ========================

Each mint may produce new coins to match the value of any coins that are
sent to a specific address. For example, if the **Bawbee** address is
sent three **Groats**, two new **Bawbees** may be minted. Coins can be
minted up to the value that has been received. Any excess is lost. So if
the **Noble** mint address is sent 8 **Shilling** coins, then one new
**Noble** coin is minted in exchange.

10. Set up a “coin exchange” with one or more colleagues. Each of you is
    responsible for one or more “mints”. You should each set up an
    exchange address and fund it with newly minted coins that are worth
    precisely twenty-one shillings. Now practice sending coins and
    changing them for ones of equivalent value. For example, if someone
    sends you two **Merk** coins, you might return one **Pound** coin
    and one **Noble** coin, or any other equivalent value that you like.
    Use transaction metadata to record the coin exchanges on-chain. If
    you cannot give the exact change, give the closest value that you
    can.

11. Adapt your exchanges so that you charge a fee of 10% for each
    transaction. Record this in a separate account. Exchange coins until
    one of you can no longer make change.

Thank you for completing the exercises!
