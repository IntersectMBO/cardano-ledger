**Fungible token/asset**

  An asset that is interchangeable and indistinguishable with some other asset(s). Same denomination bills and coins are fungible assets, for example, like equal quantities of ada to lovelaces.

**One-time minting policy**

  A type of minting policy where the complete set of tokens of a given asset group is minted by a single transaction. Same tokens cannot be minted again.

**Principal currency**

  On a cryptocurrency platform, this refers to a type of a token/asset that is used for administrative purposes, such as paying fees, delegating to a stake pool, or being minted. Cardano’s primary currency is ada, Bitcoin’s is bitcoin.

**Single-issuer policy**

  A minting policy that allows only the entity holding a particular set of keys (specified in the policy) to mint tokens of the associated asset group.

**Token builder**

  A piece of software that allows users to define tokens to be minted by a minting transaction.

**Token bundle**

  A collection of mixed tokens belonging to one or more different asset groups, usually stored in a single output.

**Token burning**

  The process of removing a token from circulation, (destroying the token).

**Token**
