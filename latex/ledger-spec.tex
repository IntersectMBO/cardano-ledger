\section{Notation}\label{sec:notation}

The transition system is explained in \cite{small_step_semantics}.

\begin{description}
  \item[Powerset] Given a set $\type{X}$, $\powerset{\type{X}}$ is the set of all
    the subsets of $X$.
  \item[Sequences] Given a set $\type{X}$, $\seqof{\type{X}}$ is the set of
    sequences having elements taken from $\type{X}$. The empty sequence is
    denoted by $\epsilon$, and given a sequence $\Lambda$, $\Lambda; \type{x}$ is
    the sequence that results from appending $\type{x} \in \type{X}$ to
    $\Lambda$.
  \item[Functions] $A \to B$ denotes a \textbf{total function} from $A$ to $B$.
    Given a function $f$ we write $f~a$ for the application of $f$ to argument
    $a$.
  \item[Inverse Image] Given a function $f: A \to B$ and $b\in B$, we write
    $f^{-1}~b$ for the \textbf{inverse image} of $f$ at $b$, which is defined by
    $\{a \mid\ f a =  b\}$.
  \item[Maps and partial functions] $A \mapsto B$ denotes a \textbf{partial
    function} from $A$ to $B$, which can be seen as a map (dictionary) with
    keys in $A$ and values in $B$. Given a map $m \in A \mapsto B$, notation
    $a \mapsto b \in m$ is equivalent to $m~ a = b$.
  \item[Map Operations] Figure \ref{fig:notation:nonstandard}
    describes some non-standard map operations.

In Figure~\ref{fig:notation:nonstandard}, we specify the notation we use in
the rest of the document.

\section{Cryptographic primitives}
\label{sec:crypto-primitives}


Figure~\ref{fig:crypto-defs} introduces the cryptographic abstractions used in
this document. We begin by listing the abstract types, which are meant to
represent the corresponding concepts in cryptography. Only the functionality
explicitly stated in the figures below is assumed within the scope of this paper.
That is, their exact
implementation remains open to interpretation, and we do not rely on
any additional properties derived from the study or implementation of public key
cryptography outside this work. The types and rules we give here are needed in
order to guarantee certain security properties of the delegation process, which
we discuss later.

The cryptographic concepts required for the formal definition
of witnessing include public-private key pairs, one-way functions
and signatures. The constraint we introduce states that a signature of
some data signed with a (private) key is only correct whenever we can verify
it using the corresponding public key.

\section{Serialization}
\label{sec:serialization}


Besides basic cryptographic abstractions, we also make use of some abstract
data storage properties in this document in order to build necessary definitions
and make judgement calls about them.

Abstract data types in this paper are essentially placeholders with names
indicating the data types they are meant to represent in an implementation.
Derived types are made up of data structures (i.e. products, lists, finite
maps, etc.) built from abstract types. The underlying structure of a data type
is implementation-dependent, and furthermore, the way the data is stored on
physical storage can vary as well.

Serialization is a physical manipulation of data on a given storage device.
In this document, the properties and rules we state involving serialization are
assumed to hold true independently of the storage medium and style of data
organization chosen for an implementation.

\section{Delegation}
\label{sec:delegation}
\input{delegation.tex}

\section{UTxO}
\label{sec:utxo}

A key constraint that must always be satisfied as a result and precondition of
a valid ledger state transition is called the \textit{general accounting
property}, or the \textit{preservation of value} condition. Every piece of
software that is a part of the implementation of the
Cardano cryptocurrency must function in such a way as to not result in
a violation of this rule.
If this condition is not satisfied, it is an indicator of
incorrect accounting, potentially due to
malicious disruption or a bug.

The preservation of value is expressed as an equality that uses values in
the ledger state and the environment, as well as the values in the body of
the signal transaction.
We have defined the rules of the delegation protocol in a way that should
consistently satisfy the preservation of value. In the future, we hope to
give a formally-verified proof that every \textit{valid} ledger state satisfies
this property.

In this section, we discuss the relevant accounting that needs to be done
as a result of processing a transaction, i.e. the deposits for all certificates,
transaction fees, transaction withdrawals, and refunds for individual
deregistration, so that we may keep track of whether the preservation of
value is satisfied. Stake pool retirement refunds are not triggered by a
transaction (but rather, happen at the epoch boundary), and are therefore
not considered in our state change rules invoked due to a signal transaction.

Note, that when a transaction is issued by a wallet to be applied to the ledger
state (i.e. processed),
we define the rules in this section in such a way that it is impossible to
apply only some parts of a transaction (e.g. only certain certificates).
Every part of the transaction must be valid and it must be live, otherwise
it is ignored entirely. It is the wallet's responsibility to inform the user
that a transaction failed to be processed.

\subsection{Deposits and Refunds}
\label{sec:deps-refunds}

The map $\fun{decay}$
represents the rate of decrease of the value of a unit of $\Coin$.
The constant returned by $\fun{decay}$ consists of two values. The first is
a natural number which determines the minimal proportion of a deposit that will
be refunded on resource release. The second is a positive rational number
used to determine the rate of (exponential) decrease of the value.

For a given transaction and protocol parameters, the map $\fun{dresource}$
returns all the certificates of that transaction which allocate resources
(i.e. the stake key and stake pool registration certificates). The map
$\fun{dderegister}$ returns the resource release certificates for the
deregistration of a stake key. The map which returns only
the retirement type certificates is $\fun{dretire}$. The function $\fun{txttl}$ gives the
time slot in which the validity of a given transaction will expire. That is,
after slot number $\fun{txttl}~\var{tx}$, the transaction will not be processed.
This value is generated by the wallet.

The functions used in refund calculations are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:functions:deposits-refunds}.
The function
$\fun{deposits}$ returns the total deposits that have to be made by a transaction.
This calculation is based on the protocol parameters.
Specifically, for a given transaction,
it sums up the values of the stake key deposits and the stake pool deposits.
Those certificates which are
updates of stake pool parameters of already registered pool keys should not
(and are, in fact, not allowed to) make a deposit.

The $\fun{isReleasing}~\var{c}$ is true for deregistration and retirement
certificates. The refund calculation gives the decayed value of a
certificate to be refunded. This fraction is calculated
based on the coin value of the registration deposit $d_{val}$, the minimum
refund coefficient $d_{min}$, the
duration between the given slot number and the slot number in
which a given resource was allocated $\delta$, and a decay rate constant $\lambda$.
The larger the duration, the more
the value of the deposit decays, down to a minimum refund value.

The function $\fun{keyRefund}$, given a set of protocol parameters, resource
allocations, slot number, and certificate, uses the refund calculation to
assign a non-zero refund to a resource releasing certificate if
the certificate’s author is listed in the provided resource allocations.
The certificate value passed to the $\fun{refund}$ calculation is obtained from
the protocol parameters based on the type of certificate (i.e. individual or pool).
The minimum and decay values are also found in the protocol parameters, while
the duration is the difference between given slot number and the slot
number associated with the author's key in the resource allocation argument.

The function $\fun{keyRefunds}$, in turn, uses $\fun{keyRefund}$ to calculate
the total value to be refunded to all individual key deregistration
certificate authors in a transaction.
Given protocol parameters, resource allocations, and a transaction,
this calculation sums up all the refunds for the individual key
deregistration certificates
carried by the given transaction by passing the relevant parameters to the
$\fun{keyRefund}$ function.

It is important to note here that instead of the \textit{current} slot number,
the time to live of $\var{tx}$ is passed to the $\fun{certRefunds}$ function
within the summation in $\fun{keyRefunds}$. The reason for this is that the
refunds for any key deregistration certificates are, in fact, included in
the $\var{tx}$ itself --- meaning that the coin value of the refund must be
explicitly specified in the outputs of the transaction. So,
the value of the included refund must be calculated before this transaction
is ever processed, and be the same \textit{no matter when} the $\var{tx}$
\textit{is actually processed} in order to allow the system to continue to
satisfy the general accounting property.

It is impossible to predict the exact slot
number in which $\var{tx}$ will be processed, but it will be some time before
slot number $\fun{txttl}~\var{tx}$. So, this is the slot number value used in both
the calculation to generate the refund coin value in the outputs of $\var{tx}$
and in the general accounting property equation.

Note that since the refund is based
on the original deposit paid (as indicated in the protocol parameters that
were valid in the time slot the deposit was made), the accounting or the slot
number do not also need to be updated in any way when updating pool constants with
a certificate.

Note also that
$\fun{keyRefunds}$ calculates the total individual refunds for a transaction
based on \textit{current} protocol parameters. This means that any deposits
made prior to a change will be different from their corresponding
(decayed) refunds in the case of key deregistration after a change in
protocol parameters. Constants may only change at the epoch boundary, and
ensuring there are always sufficient funds for all
refunds in the $\var{deposits}$ pool is part of the protocol constant
change transition, described in Section~\ref{sec:epoch}.

The protocol parameters are not
expected to change often, and using the current ones for the calculation
is a deliberate simplification choice, which does not introduce any inconsistencies
into the system rules or properties. In particular, the general accounting
property is not violated.

Finally, note that a refund for a resource-releasing certificate in a
transaction can only be issued if the refund is bigger than the minimum
transaction fee. In order to receive a refund in this case, the transaction
body must also contain inputs onto which this refund can be added.

\end{figure}


We define the functions used in calculating deposits in
Figure~\ref{fig:functions:deposits-refunds}.
The $\fun{lastEpoch}$ function
returns the number of the last slot in the previous epoch.

In order to give the full expression of the general accounting property,
we need the value of the total amount of decay for all the resource releasing
certificates of a transaction whose authors key is registered. For each
certificate in this calculation, the value is computed by the map $\fun{decayed}$.
Given a set of protocol parameters, resource allocations, and a slot
number, this map outputs the difference between the decayed refund calculated from
the last slot of the previous epoch of the given slot number
(or the certificate creation slot, if it is created in the same epoch as the
given slot number) and the
full-duration decayed refund value ($\fun{currentRefund}$) calculated based on
the given slot number.

The amount decayed for individual keys is then computed by adding the values of
$$\fun{decayed}~\var{stkeys}~\var{pc}~(\fun{txttl}~\var{tx})~\var{c}$$
for each deregistration certificate in a given transaction, and is given by
$$\fun{decatedTx}~\var{pc}~\var{stkeys}~\var{cslot}~\var{c}$$
Here, again, we use the $\fun{txttl}~\var{tx}$ value in the calculation instead of the current
slot number in order to match with the one in the $\fun{keyRefunds}$
calculation.

Note that the decayed amount here is only the amount that decayed \textit{within
the epoch until which the signal transaction is live}, i.e. since the end of the
last epoch before $\fun{txttl}~\var{tx}$, or, if the key was
registered in the same epoch as the $\fun{txttl}~\var{tx}$ slot,
since the registration certificate slot number.

Recall that the stake pool retirement refunds are issued not when a certificate
scheduling the retirement is processed, but at the epoch boundary for which
the retirement is scheduled. The decayed value over the full previous epoch is
also accounted for at the boundary change. For details of this accounting, see
Section~\cref{sec:epoch}.

\subsection{UTxO Transitions}
\label{sec:state-trans-utxo-1}

The types involved in defining a UTxO and its transitions are presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:defs:utxo}. Note that here, among other primitive types,
we introduce $\Addr_{base}$. This is the usual type of address used for
coin transfers by the transactions. We also introduce the derived type $\Addr$,
which is a disjoint union of base-type and reward addresses. Using this type,
it is possible to do rewards accounting (which we discuss later in this chapter)
in the same $\UTxO$ style as the base address coin transfers, as well as
the usual base address lookups and calculations.
Similar to the certificate structure, each address is either a reward or a base
address.

The $\TxIn$ derived type represents the inputs of a transaction, i.e. a list of
previous transactions identified by $\var{txid}$, paired with an index
$\var{ix}$ to
uniquely identify the input (as there may be several inputs from the same
transaction). The $\TxOut$ type is a pair of an address and a coin value,
which is a record of what address the given coin amount is intended for.

The $\UTxO$ type is the main record type stored on the ledger to keep track of
unspent transaction outputs. It does so by using a finite map which pairs
a transaction ID with \textit{its own outputs} (by using the $\var{ix}$ indices),
thus indicating that these
can now be spent by another transaction.

The type $\Wdrl$ is a finite map that maps a reward address to a coin value to
be withdrawn from the rewards awarded to that address. We have made the decision
to structure the withdrawals in this way to adhere as closely as possible
to the structure presented in~\cite{chimeric}.

The map $\fun{txid}$ is a one-way function which computes the $\var{txid}$
of a given transaction. A transaction can be uniquely identified
by its $\var{txid}$ in a given context.

The $\fun{txbody}$ map gives the body of the transaction, i.e. the data that is
used to update the UTxO on the ledger. The way this data is stored is in
a pair of a set of terms of type $\TxIn$ representing the inputs of the
transaction, and a finite map $\Ix \mapsto \TxOut$ representing the outputs.
Each term in the input list
corresponds to those $\TxOut$ terms in the outputs list indexed by the same
$\Ix$ as in the second coordinate of the input. This way, a transaction can have
inputs from multiple prior transactions and outputs to multiple addresses
from each of the input transactions.

The transaction fee $\fun{txfee}$ is the
fee a transaction contributes to the system (this value depends only on
the transaction itself). The fee does not need to have an explicit output
specified, and are currently implicitly included in the total input value of
a transaction.

Note that transaction fees, which can be greater than the minimum fee, are
indicated in the transactions themselves. This is different from
the deposit amounts for registration certificates, which are
indicated explicitly in the protocol parameters,
and must be paid as an amount exactly matching the protocol's requirement.
For this reason, a refund calculation for given certificate does not need to look up the deposit
amount in the data of the transaction
that paid the original registration deposit (such data is not even stored),
but instead looks in the protocol
parameters for this information.

The $\fun{minfee}$ is the minimum
fee that must be paid by a transaction to be applied to the current UTxO.
This minimum fee
is calculated based on the context of the transaction (i.e. a collection of
values the blockchain protocol keeps track of, $\PParams$), as well as
the contents of the transaction itself.

The $\fun{txwdrls}$ function returns a list of reward addresses provided by a
given transaction, each paired with the coin value the transaction is requesting
be reaped, i.e. removed from the total coin accumulated in the rewards
account for this address and added to the UTxO.

  \caption{Definitions used in the UTxO transition system}
  \label{fig:defs:utxo}
\end{figure*}


A set of functions on UTxOs and transactions appearing in this document,
along with their types are defined in Figure~\ref{fig:derived-defs:utxo}.
The map $\fun{txins}$ returns the list of inputs of a given transactions, i.e.
the pairs type $\TxIn$ within that transaction.

The map $\fun{outs}~ \var{tx}$ builds a UTxO using the
list of outputs of $\var{tx}$. It builds a pair for the resulting UTxO
finite map by making a $txin$ out of the $txid$ of $tx$ and an index in the output $ix \mapsto (a,c)$, to give a $txin = (txid, ix)$ and the
$txout=(a,c)$.

The $\fun{balance}$ map, as expected, gives the sum total of all the coin in
a given UTxO. The calculation $\fun{consumed}$ gives the value consumed
by the transaction $\var{tx}$ in the context of the relevant protocol
parameters, the current UTxO on the ledger, and the resource allocation for
$\DState$, i.e. $\var{stkeys}$. This calculation is a sum of all coin in the inputs of
$\var{tx}$  and the individual key
deregistration refunds of the $\var{tx}$ in this context.

Next, we define the function $\fun{reapRewards}$. The purpose of this map is
to update all the rewards accounts associated with the addresses for which
reward withdrawals are requested. Since we do only allow withdrawal of reward
amount which is exactly equal to the value in the reward account (we
give details about this below), this update explicitly sets the values
associated to the requested addresses to zero.

The $\fun{consumed}$ calculation sums up all the unspent outputs that
have been removed from the ledger. This includes the outputs spent directly
(made available to the owner of another address), and also, implicitly,
the outputs which are spent on transaction fees. In order to balance
the preservation of value equation, we must also add the following values
to this (the LHS, i.e. $\fun{consumed}$) side of the equation as they are
accounted for implicitly (as
part of appending to the UTxO the entries of $\fun{outs}~{tx}$), on the
other side (RHS):

\begin{itemize}
\item The total value of all individual key refunds the transaction is taking from
the (common) $\var{deposit}$ pool
\item The total value of all the rewards the transaction is withdrawing from
the individual $\var{rewards}$ accounts
\end{itemize}

The total rewards value above is calculated by subtracting the sum total value in the
updated (after payout) rewards addresses from sum total of the current (pre-rewards
payout state) of the $\var{rewards}$ map.

The $\fun{consumed}$ calculation, on the other hand, sums up the total
value of all unspent outputs added to the UTxO on the ledger. As stated
above, this value implicitly includes all the unspent outputs generated
by this transaction for the withdrawing the refunds and the rewards
(from the corresponding ledger accounts). In addition, this (RHS) of the
equation must account for the value implicitly removed from the UTxO. That is why
two more values are added to this side of the equation:

\begin{itemize}
\item the fee the transaction pays (in unspent outputs)
\item all registration
deposits the transaction pays (also in unspent outputs)
\end{itemize}

We remind the reader here that even though the $\fun{consumed}$ calculation
takes $\var{stpools}$ as a parameter, this is only in order to determine,
within the $\fun{deposits}$ calculation, which
pool registration certificates are new registrations, and which ones are updates
(and do not require a deposit payment). The $\fun{deposits}$ calculation is
a sum of \textit{all} deposits a transaction is making, and the value of these
deposits is found in the protocol parameters, not in $\var{stkeys}$ or $\var{stpools}$.

The type of the transition of a UTxO is presented in Figure
~\ref{fig:ts-types:utxo}. A
transition can be valid in the context of a given environment, $\UTxOEnv$.
This environment is made up of several variables.
The $\PParams$ is needed as part of the environment here in order to
keep track of parameters such as the $\fun{minfee}$ value, deposits, etc.
The environment also has variables $\var{stkeys}$ and $\var{stpools}$
to keep track of the current individual and pool resource allocations,
and the current slot number.

The relevant state variables for a UTxO transition include the UTxO itself,
as well as the value in the deposits pool and the fees pool.
The type of UTxO update is a $\UTxOState$ transition signaled by
a transaction $\var{tx}$ in the environment $\UTxOEnv$.

\subsection{UTxO, Fees, and Deposits Ledger Update}
\label{sec:utxo-ufd}

The inference rule for the UTxO, fees, and deposits update is presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:rules:utxo}.
Rule~\ref{eq:utxo-inductive} specifies the conditions under which a transaction can
be applied to a particular $\UTxOState$ in environment $\UTxOEnv$:

\begin{itemize}
\item The transaction is live (its time to live is less than the current slot)
\item The transaction has at least one input
\item The fee paid by the transaction has to be greater than or equal to the
minimum fee.
\item Each input spent in the transaction must be in the set of unspent
  outputs
\item The amount of coin produced by the transaction must be the same as
the amount consumed (i.e. the \textit{preservation of value} must hold)
\end{itemize}

Note that the fee paid by a transaction is required to be greater than or
equal to the minim fee. The reason for allowing it to be greater is to have
the option for the implementation to make processing decisions based on the
size of the fee. Such as, a larger fee would result in faster processing of
a transaction.

The transaction is required to have at least one input to avoid a situation
where the witnessing replay protection may fail. Specifically, when a transaction is
spending only refunds from deregistration or retirement certificates it is
carrying (or withdrawn rewards).

Here we again emphasize the importance of the \textit{preservation of value}
condition. No valid UTxO state can be reached without this condition
being satisfied at every step of the transitions leading to a given UTxO state.
Since the total amout of Ada at genesis is known, this property can be
checked for arbitrarily generated valid ledgers.

According to this complete ledger state transition rule, when a UTxO state update
is triggered by a
transaction (signal) $\var{tx}$, and the above conditions are met, the UTxO
changes as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item remove from the UTxO all the $(\var{txin}, \var{txout})$ pairs
associated with the $\var{txins}$'s in the $\var{inputs}$ list of $\var{tx}$.
\item add all the $\var{outputs}$ of $\var{tx}$ to the
UTxO, associated with the $\fun{txid}~\var{tx}$
\end{itemize}

Note here that output entries for both the deposit refunds and the rewards
withdrawals must be included in the body of the transaction
carrying the deregistration certificates (requesting these refunds) and the
reward requests. It is the job
of the wallet to calculate the value of these refunds and withdrawals, and
generate the correct outputs to include in the outputs list of $\var{tx}$ such
that applying this transaction results in a
valid ledger update adding correct amounts of coin to the right addresses.

The majority of funds moved by a transaction usually come from unspent outputs
(i.e. the $(txid, ix)$ pairs in the inputs of a transaction). The claiming of
refunds and rewards works slightly differently. These get included in the outputs list
only. That is, they do not have any index-matched inputs in the $inputs$ list.
For each requested refund (or withdrawal), the
wallet generates a brand-new index $ix$, then indicates the $(addr,coin)$ value
pairing the address to which the refund is going and the refund amount.
So, this output $(ix \mapsto (addr,coin))$ gets added to $outputs$ of $tx$,
and it follows that $\fun{outs}~{tx}$ is a UTxO that contains the entry
$(\fun{txid}~{tx}, ix) \mapsto (addr,coin)$.

The approach of including refunds and rewards directly in the $outputs$ gives
great flexibility to the management of the coin value obtained from these
accounts, i.e. it can be directed to any address. However, it means there is no
direct link between the $wdrls$ requests (similarly, the key deregistration
certificate addresses and refund amounts) and the $outputs$. We verify that
the included outputs are correct and authorized through the preservation of value condition
and witnessing the transaction. The combination of the
preservation of value and witnessing, described in Section~\ref{sec:witnesses},
assures that the ledger state is updated correctly.

The main difference, however, in how rewards and refunds work is that refunds
come from a $\var{deposits}$ pool, which is a single coin value indicating
the total decayed amount of all the deposits ever made, while rewards come from individual
accounts where a reward is accumulated to a specific address.

The $\var{deposits}$ is updated by:

\begin{itemize}
\item add all the deposits for individual and key registration certificates
carried by the signal transaction to the current $\var{deposits}$ value on the ledger
\item subtract from the current $\var{deposits}$ value on the ledger
the amount by which the deposits for the individual key allocations
for which $\var{tx}$ carries the deregistration certificates have
decayed \textit{this epoch}
\item subtract any individual key refunds for deregistration certificates
in $\var{tx}$ from the current $\var{deposits}$ value on the ledger
\end{itemize}

Note that the $\var{refunded}$ and $\var{decayed}$ values added together give what the
full, non-decayed refund for all the key deregistration certificates in $\var{tx}$
would be, and this total value is always removed from the $\var{deposits}$
amount on the leger. The $\var{refunded}$ amount is returned to the certificate
author, and the $\var{decayed}$ amount is transferred over to $\var{fees}$
(this allows the ledger to adhere to the preservation of value).

Note also that the reason only the decayed value of requested refunds
from \textit{this epoch} is transferred to fees is that at the epoch
boundary, the total decayed value for the whole epoch for both the individual
and pool deposits is transferred into the fees (independent of refund
requests).

Now, the fees are updated by:

\begin{itemize}
\item add the transaction fee paid by the signal transaction to the ledger $\var{fees}$
variable
\item add the decayed value of key refunds in certificates in $\var{tx}$ to $\var{fees}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Witnesses}
\label{sec:witnesses}

A transaction is witnessed by
a signature and a verification key corresponding to this signature, which can
be obtained from the transaction by applying the $\fun{txwits}$ function.
The witnesses for each certificate in a transaction are obtained by applying $\fun{dwits}$
to the certificate.

In Figure~\ref{fig:derived-defs:utxow}, we give the definitions of two maps
associated with input and reward addresses and their keys.
The first, $\fun{addr}$, gives the finite map
which associates to a given $\var{txin}$ in the UTxO the address of the
corresponding $\var{txout}$.

The map $\fun{addr_h}$, given a UTxO, returns the
finite map which associates $\var{txin}$ with the hash of a spending key in
the address in the corresponding $\var{txout}$ in the UTxO. The way this is
done is by performing a lookup of the address owner using the
$\fun{paymentHK}$ function,
which retrieves the hash of the key of
the owner from the data stored at the given address.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{align*}
    & \fun{witsNeeded} \in \UTxO \to \Tx \to \powerset{\HashKey}
    & \text{hashkeys for needed witnesses} \\
    & \fun{witsNeeded}~{utxo}~{tx} = \\
    & ~~\{ \fun{paymentHK}~a \mid i \mapsto (a, \wcard) \in \var{utxo},~i\in\txins{tx} \}~\cup \\
    & ~~\{\fun{stakeHK_r}~a \mid a\mapsto \wcard \in \txwdrls{tx}\}~\cup \\
    & ~~\{\cauthor{c} \mid c \in \txcerts{tx}\}~\cup \\
    & ~~\bigcup_{\substack{c \in \txcerts{tx} \\ ~c \in\DCertRegPool}} \fun{poolowners}~{c} \\
  \end{align*}
  \caption{Functions used in witness rule}
  \label{fig:derived-defs:utxow}
\end{figure}


Note that the UTxO transitions with and without witnesses have the same type
(see Figure~\ref{fig:ts-types:utxo} and Figure~\ref{fig:ts-types:utxow}).
The witnessed transition rule, in fact, defines the same UTxO update as the
non-witnessed rule. Essentially, the witnessed rule says we may only apply the non-witnessed rule whenever the following
additional preconditions are satisfied
(stated in Rule~\ref{eq:utxo-witness-inductive} in
Figure~\ref{fig:rules:utxow}):

\begin{itemize}
 \item For each input $\var{i}$ of the signal transaction $\var{tx}$,
 there exists a (unique) verifiable witness (there could be more than one valid
 key-signature pair serving as a witness) such that the hash of the spending key
 of the address corresponding to the output of $\var{i}$ in the current UTxO
 is the same as the hash of the verification key of the witness.

 \item For each certificate in $\var{tx}$, the signature of the transaction
 and certificate must be witnessed by the
   verification key with which the certificate is associated

 \item For every withdrawal request address of $\var{tx}$,
 there exists a (unique) verifiable witness such that the hash of the spending key of the
 withdrawal address is the same as the hash of the verification key of the witness.
\end{itemize}

The purpose of witnessing is make sure that the intended action is authorized by
the holder of the signing key, providing replay protection as a consequence.
Replay prevention is an inherent property of UTxO type accounting
since transaction IDs are unique.
Delegation certificates and reward withdrawals do not share this property,
though if we require all witnesses to sign at least one transaction input,
the replay prevention of UTxO accounting is then provided to any transaction.
This is achieved by the above precondition by requiring a valid signature
from the author of every certificate in a transaction, the
holder of the key for every reward account emptied, as well as
hash keys of each of the inputs addresses.

Furthermore, expressing
accounting as a preservation of total value of Ada allows the withdrawals
and refunds to be sent to any address the transaction indicates
(such as a different wallet operated by the same or another owner).
Because of witnessing, we know that all the value withdrawn from ledger
pools ($\var{rewards}$ and $\var{deposits}$) is going to the address intended
(i.e signed) by the deregistration certificate author
(or the key holder for the addresses from which the withdrawal is made,
respectively).

Here, we also enforce the condition that only one witness per each input,
as well as one
witness per withdrawal address is allowed. We do so to prevent transactions
being unnecessarily large and full of redundant witnessing.

\subsection{Ledger State Transition}
\label{sec:ledger}

Having formalized the transitions of state variables above, we can
now combine these into a single a ledger transition type (and inference rule).
The environment for this rule is parametrized by the current slot number and
protocol parameters.

The full ledger state consists of a $\UTxOState$ state variable (keeping track of
the UTxO, deposits, fees, etc.), as well as
a $\DPState$ state variable (which keeps track of registered keys and pools).
This state type and the type of the transition rule is given in
(see Figure~\ref{fig:ts-types:ledger}). The ledger state transition is signaled
by a transaction.

\begin{figure}
  \emph{Ledger environment}
  \begin{equation*}
    \LEnv =
    \left(
      \begin{array}{r@{~\in~}lr}
        \var{slot} & \Slot & \text{current slot}\\
        \var{txIx} & \Ix & \text{transaction index}\\
        \var{pp} & \PParams & \text{protocol parameters}\\
      \end{array}
    \right)
  \end{equation*}
  %

      \begin{array}{r@{~\in~}lr}
        \var{utxoSt} & \UTxOState & \text{UTxO state}\\
        \var{dpstate} & \DPState & \text{delegation and pool state}\\
      \end{array}
    \right)
  \end{equation*}
  %
  \emph{Ledger transitions}
  \begin{equation*}
    \_ \vdash
    \var{\_} \trans{ledger}{\_} \var{\_}
    \subseteq \powerset (\LEnv \times \LState \times \Tx \times \LState)
  \end{equation*}
  \caption{Ledger transition-system types}
  \label{fig:ts-types:ledger}
\end{figure}


The inference rule describing the complete ledger state transition is given in
Figure~\ref{fig:rules:ledger}. The consequent of the rule is triggered by
a transaction $\var{tx}$ such that both the (witnessed) ledger state transition
and the complete delegation state transition in the antecedent are
triggered by that same transaction.

Note that the context for the consequent transaction is made up of only the
protocol parameters and slot number, and so is the delegation state transition in
the antecedent. However, the $\UTxOState$ transition also contains the
stake keys and stake pools resource allocations in the context. This is not
an issue since all this difference is highlighting is that in a $\UTxOState$
transition, these variables are immutable (but they do change in the full
ledger state and the $\DPState$ transitions).

The full ledger state transition combines the UTxO transition and the
delegation transition into a single transition
in the consequent, presented as a transition of both state variables signaled
by the given transaction.
