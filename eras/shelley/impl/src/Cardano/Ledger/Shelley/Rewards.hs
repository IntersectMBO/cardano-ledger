-- | Compute the Non-Myopic Pool Member Reward
--
--   This function implements equation (3) in section 5.6.4
--   of "Design Specification for Delegation and Incentives in Cardano".
--   Note that the protocol parameters and the reward pot are implicit
--   in the design document. Additionally, instead of passing a rank
--   r to compare with k, we pass the top k desirable pools and
--   check for membership.
