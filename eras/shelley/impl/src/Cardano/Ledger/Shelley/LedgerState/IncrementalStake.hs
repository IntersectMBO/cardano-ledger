-- There are three parts to IncrementalStaking.
-- 1) The incremental part, where we keep track of each update to the UTxO
--    adding Inputs and deleting consumed Outputs. Done in the Utxo rules.
-- 2) Finalizing and aggregating by stake credential to create a Snapshot.
--    done in the Snap rules.
-- 3) Applying the RewardUpdate, to the Rewards component of the UMap.
--    done in the NewEpoch rules.

-- | A valid (or self-consistent) UTxOState{utxosUtxo, utxosDeposited , utxosFees  , utxosPpups , utxosStakeDistr}
--   maintains an invariant between the utxosUtxo and utxosStakeDistr fields. the utxosStakeDistr field is
--   the aggregation of Coin over the StakeReferences in the UTxO. It can be computed by a pure
--   function from the _utxo field. In some situations, mostly unit or example tests, or when
--   initializing a small UTxO, we want to create a UTxOState that computes the utxosStakeDistr from
--   the utxosUtxo. This is aways safe to do, but if the utxosUtxo field is big, this can be very expensive,
--   which defeats the purpose of memoizing the utxosStakeDistr field. So use of this function should be
--   restricted to tests and initializations, where the invariant should be maintained.

-- Part 2. Compute a Snapshot using the IncrementalStake in Snap rule
-- =======================================================================

-- | This computes a Snapshot using IncrementalStake (which is an
--   aggregate of the current UTxO) and UMap (which tracks Coin,
--   Delegations, and Ptrs simultaneously).  Note that logically:
--   1) IncrementalStake = (credStake, ptrStake)
--   2) UMap = (rewards, activeDelegs, ptrmap :: Map ptr cred)
--
--   Using this scheme the logic can do 3 things in one go, without touching the UTxO.
--   1) Resolve Pointers
--   2) Throw away things not actively delegated
--   3) Add up the coin
--
--   The Stake distribution function (Map cred coin) (the first component of a SnapShot)
--   is defined by this SetAlgebra expression:
--   (dom activeDelegs) ◁ (aggregate+ (credStake ∪ ptrStake ∪ rewards))
--
--   We can apply meaning preserving operations to get equivalent expressions
--
--   (dom activeDelegs) ◁ (aggregate+ (credStake ∪ ptrStake ∪ rewards))
--   aggregate+ (dom activeDelegs ◁ (credStake ∪ ptrStake ∪ rewards))
--   aggregate+ ((dom activeDelegs ◁ credStake) ∪ (dom activeDelegs ◁ ptrStake) ∪ (dom activeDelegs ◁ rewards))
--
--   We will compute this in several steps
--   step1 = (dom activeDelegs ◁ credStake) ∪ (dom activeDelegs ◁ ptrStake)
--   step2 =  aggregate (dom activeDelegs ◁ rewards) step1
--   This function has a non-incremental analog, 'stakeDistr', mosty used in tests, which does use the UTxO.
