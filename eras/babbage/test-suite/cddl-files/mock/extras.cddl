bounded_bytes = bytes .size (0..64)
  ; the real bounded_bytes does not have this limit. it instead has a different
  ; limit which cannot be expressed in CDDL.
  ; The limit is as follows:
  ;  - bytes with a definite-length encoding are limited to size 0..64
  ;  - for bytes with an indefinite-length CBOR encoding, each chunk is
  ;    limited to size 0..64
  ;  ( reminder: in CBOR, the indefinite-length encoding of bytestrings
  ;    consists of a token #2.31 followed by a sequence of definite-length
  ;    encoded bytestrings and a stop code )
