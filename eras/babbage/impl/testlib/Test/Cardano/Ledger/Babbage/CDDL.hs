    [str|This is a hash of data which may affect evaluation of a script.
        |This data consists of:
        |  - The redeemers from the transaction_witness_set (the value of field 5).
        |  - The datums from the transaction_witness_set (the value of field 4).
        |  - The value in the costmdls map corresponding to the script's language
        |    (in field 18 of protocol_param_update.)
        |(In the future it may contain additional protocol parameters.)
        |
        |Since this data does not exist in contiguous form inside a transaction, it needs
        |to be independently constructed by each recipient.
        |
        |The bytestring which is hashed is the concatenation of three things:
        |  redeemers || datums || language views
        |The redeemers are exactly the data present in the transaction witness set.
        |Similarly for the datums, if present. If no datums are provided, the middle
        |field is omitted (i.e. it is the empty/null bytestring).
        |
        |language views CDDL:
        |{ * language => script_integrity_data }
        |
        |This must be encoded canonically, using the same scheme as in
        |RFC7049 section 3.9:
        | - Maps, strings, and bytestrings must use a definite-length encoding
        | - Integers must be as small as possible.
        | - The expressions for map length, string length, and bytestring length
        |   must be as short as possible.
        | - The keys in the map must be sorted as follows:
        |    -  If two keys have different lengths, the shorter one sorts earlier.
        |    -  If two keys have the same length, the one with the lower value
        |       in (byte-wise) lexical order sorts earlier.
        |
        |For PlutusV1 (language id 0), the language view is the following:
        |  - the value of costmdls map at key 0 (in other words, the script_integrity_data)
        |    is encoded as an indefinite length list and the result is encoded as a bytestring.
        |    (our apologies)
        |    For example, the script_integrity_data corresponding to the all zero costmodel for V1
        |    would be encoded as (in hex):
        |    58a89f00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ff
        |  - the language ID tag is also encoded twice. first as a uint then as
        |    a bytestring. (our apologies)
        |    Concretely, this means that the language version for V1 is encoded as
        |    4100 in hex.
        |For PlutusV2 (language id 1), the language view is the following:
        |  - the value of costmdls map at key 1 is encoded as an definite length list.
        |    For example, the script_integrity_data corresponding to the all zero costmodel for V2
        |    would be encoded as (in hex):
        |    98af0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
        |  - the language ID tag is encoded as expected.
        |    Concretely, this means that the language version for V2 is encoded as
        |    01 in hex.
        |
        |Note that each Plutus language represented inside a transaction must have
        |a cost model in the costmdls protocol parameter in order to execute,
        |regardless of what the script integrity data is.
        |
        |Finally, note that in the case that a transaction includes datums but does not
        |include the redeemers field, the script data format becomes (in hex):
        |[ 80 | datums | A0 ]
        |corresponding to a CBOR empty list and an empty map.
        |Note that a transaction might include the redeemers field and set it to the
        |empty map, in which case the user supplied encoding of the empty map is used.
