-- | Non-Native Script language. This is an Enumerated type.
-- This is expected to be an open type. We will add new Constuctors
-- to this type as additional Non-Native scripting language as are added.
-- We use an enumerated type for two reasons.
-- 1) We can write total functions by case analysis over the constructors
-- 2) We will use DataKinds to make some datatypes  indexed by Language
-- For now, the only Non-Native Scriting language is Plutus
-- We might add new languages in the futures.
--
-- Note that the the serialization of 'Language' depends on the ordering.
