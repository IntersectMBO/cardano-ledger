\section{Introduction}

Currently still todo:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reward calculation wart fixes
\item Adjust TxInfo
\item Update minUTxO
\end{itemize}

This specification describes the incremental changes from the Alonzo
era of Cardano to the Babbage era. The main objective of this era is
to make small adjustments in many places, usually to simplify the
ledger or to include features that didn't make it into past eras. As
part of this effort, we also make some changes to the notation used in
these specifications, which should make them easier to understand and
maintain.

Concretely, this specification makes the following changes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Add reference inputs to transactions
\item Add inline datums in the UTxO
\item Add reference scripts
\item Add transaction fields for specifying and returning collateral
\item Remove the protocol parameter $\var{d}$ and the overlay schedule
\end{itemize}
