# Lessons learned from last week

 - When challenges come up while working on an issue, then create a new issue
   for this with additional estimation
 - Connect PRs to issues, can be several PRs for one issue

# Things to try next week

 - Think about merging `cardano-ledger-specs` into `cardano-chain`
