\section{Introduction}

The purpose of stake pool ranking is to provide a recommendation to users
(wallets, people who own ADA, etc)
for the stake pools which are expected to yield the greatest rewards.
The ranking is based upon past performance but should be a useful predictor of future performance.

A naive approach would be to rank pools based on the rewards that are
currently being paid out to its delegators.
There are at least two problems with this approach.

First, the naive approach is short-sighted in the sense that it does not take into
account what a newly formed stake pool would yield when it reaches saturation.
This issue is explained in detail in \cite{bkks2018}. The problem as applied to
Cardano is explained in the delegation design doc \cite[Section 5.6]{delegation_design}.

The second problem is that sometimes a stake pool has the opportunity to produce blocks,
but doesn't due to things like a bad network connection or untimely downtime. The rate at
which a pool uses their opportunities to make blocks, which we will call hit rate, affects rewards.
It needs to be taken into account.

Our aim is to address both concerns.

\section{Hit Rate}

The pool operator is the only one who knows their
hit rate since others do not have access to their VRF calculation.
Others can only try to divine it using the public knowledge of the
pool's relative stake and number of blocks produced.

\subsection{Estimation}

Each slot, a stake pool with relative (active) stake $\sigma_a$ has probability
\[ 1 - (1-f)^{\sigma_a} \]
of producing a block, where $f$ is the active slot coefficient.
We can use this to estimate the hit rate.

We represent such an estimate as a probability distribution on the interval $[0,1]$.

After each epoch, we refine our estimate into a more accurate one as follows.

Let's say we
observe the output of a stake pool during an epoch. We have a previous estimate, $w$, the
epoch has $E$ slots, the pool produces $n$ blocks, and we calculate that on a given slot
the chance they're allowed to produce a block is $t$.

We compute the likelihood function, $L$, where $L(x)$ is the probability of producing exactly $n$ blocks,

\[ L(x) = \left( E \atop n \right) S(x)^{n} (1-S(x))^{E - n}, \]

and $S(x)$ is the probability that the pool produces a block at a given slot under the assumption that the
hit rate, $p$, is equal to $x$.

\[
\begin{array}{r@{=}l}
S(x) & P( \text{made block} | p = x) \\
     & t \cdot P( \text{made block} | p = x,~\text{can}) + (1-t) \cdot P( \text{made block} | p = x,~\text{can't}) \\
     & tx                              + (1-t) \cdot 0 \\
     & tx \\
\end{array}
\]

Our refined estimate is then $q(x) = \frac{w(x)L(x)}{\int w(x)L(x)}$.

By calculating a running product, $\mathcal{L}$, of likelihood functions, we can defer this computation.

At the time that a user wishes to produce a ranking, they will
supply a prior distribution. This is a default estimate applied to pools for which we don't have any historical data.

To make the rankings we use the posterior distribution,

\begin{equation}
\label{post}
q(x) = \frac{w_(x)\mathcal{L}(x)}{\int w(x)\mathcal{L}(x)}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Implementation}

We approximate a probability density function, $g$, using a sequence of sample points,

\[ A(g) = \big(\ln(g(0.005)),~ \ln(g(0.015)),~ \ldots,~ \ln(g(0.995))\big). \]

This lets us use multiplication rather than exponentiation for most of our calculations.

Because of the normalization step in \eqref{post}, any scalar multiple of $g$
will yield the same result in the end. So any constant shift of $A(g)$ will as well.
To ensure that our numbers don't grow too large, we use the normal form

\[ A'(g) = \big(\ln(g(0.005)) - m,~ \ln(g(0.015)) - m,~ \ldots,~ \ln(g(0.995)) - m\big), \]
where $m$ is the minimal sample point. We use $g_i$ to denote the $i$'th term of $A'(g)$.

For each stake pool, every epoch we compute this approximation, add it to our previous sum, and convert it to this normal form.

To calculate the final pdf used in ranking, we approximate \eqref{post}.
If $\mathcal{L}$ is our cumulative likelihood
and $w$ is our prior, we use

\[ q_i = e^{w_i + \mathcal{L}_i} / S, \]
where
\[ S = \sum (0.01) e^{w_i + \mathcal{L}_i}. \]

In the ranking calculation, we use the $k$'th percentile of this distribution for some $k$.
We do so by computing the minimal $i$ such that the sum of $[q_0,~\ldots,q_i]$ is at least $k$.
Then $i/100$ is the $k$'th percentile.

Putting it all together, given some prior distribution,
a percentile, and a cumulative likelihood,
we estimate the hit rate to be $i/100$.


\subsection{Example}

Let's say Alice's pool has been active for two epochs.
There are 432,000 slots per epoch, and the active slot coefficient is 0.05
(the mainnet values at the time of writing).

During the first epoch, the relative stake was $0.001$ and 10 blocks were produced.

During the second epoch, the relative stake was $0.01$ and 200 blocks were produced.

We calculate $\ln(L_1(x))$ for the first epoch as follows.

With relative stake $0.001$, the probability of being allowed to produce a block on
each slot is

\[ t_1 = 1-(1-0.05)^{0.001}, \]
and $S_1(x)= t_1x$

Since 10 blocks were produced, the real likelihood function is

\[ L_1(x) =  \left( 432,000 \atop 10 \right) (t_1x)^{10} (1-t_1x)^{431,990} \]

and we will use
\[
\begin{array}{rl}
  \ell_1(x) &= \ln\left( (t_1x)^{10} (t_1x)^{431,990} \right) \\
            &= 10 \ln(t_1 x) + 431,990 \ln(1 - t_1 x) \\
\end{array}
\]
for storing information about Alice's pool's performance this epoch.
In particular, we store

\[ A'(L_1) = [\ell_1(0.005)-m_1,~\ell_1(0.015)-m_1,~\ldots,~\ell_1(.995)-m_1] \]
where $m_1=\min\{\ell_1(0.005),\ldots,\ell_1(0.995)\}$

For the second epoch,
\[
\begin{array}{rl}
  t_2 &= 1-(1-0.05)^{0.01} \\
  \ell_2(x) &= 200 \ln(t_2 x) + 431,800 \ln(1 - t_2 x).\\
\end{array}
\]
Then for the second epoch we store:
\[ A'(L_2) = [\ell_2(0.005)+\ell_1(0.005)-m_2,~\ldots,~\ell_2(.995)+\ell_1(.995)-m_2] \]
where $m_2=\min\{\ell_2(0.005)+\ell_1(0.005),\ldots,\ell_2(0.995)+\ell_1(0.995)\}$.

\section{Ranking and Saturation}

We now describe how to use the hit rate estimation to calculate the stake pool ranking
described in \cite{bkks2018} and \cite[Section 5.6]{delegation_design}.

First we must turn the sampling of the likelihood functions into a concrete value.
Given a percentage, $k$, we will calculate the $k$'th percentile of the hit rates.
Currently we're using the 10\%, but we aim for this to be user configurable.
For a given pool, let $h_k$ denote the $k$'th percentile.

Following \cite[Section 5.6.1]{delegation_design},
we can compute any given stake pool's rewards at saturation with:
\[
    \tilde{f}(s, \pbar) :=
    \hat{f}(s,z_0,\pbar)=
    \frac{\pbar R}{1 + a_0}
    \cdot
    \left(z_0 + \min(s,z_0)\cdot a_0\right).
\]

where $\bar{p}$ is the \textit{apparent performance} defined in
\cite[Section 5.5.2]{delegation_design}.
We will substitute our hit rate estimation $h_k$ for the apparent performance $\bar{p}$,
Given a pool with pledged owner stake \(s\), costs \(c\) and margin \(m\),
the desirability function of \cite[Section 5.6.1]{delegation_design} becomes:
\[
    d(c, m, s, h_k) :=
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \displaystyle 0 &
        \text{if $\tilde{f}(s,h_k)\leq c$,} \\
        \displaystyle\left(\tilde{f}(s,h_k) - c\right)\cdot(1-m) &
        \text{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
    \right.
\]
From here, we proceed exactly as in
\cite[Section 5.6.2]{delegation_design} and
\cite[Section 5.6.4]{delegation_design}.

The desirability function provides a ranking of stake pools.
For a stake pool with pledged owner stake $s$, total stake $\sigma$ and rank
$r$, we define its \emph{non-myopic stake} $\sigma_\mathrm{nm}$ as
\[
    \sigma_\mathrm{nm}(s,\sigma,r) :=
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \max(\sigma,z_0) &
        \text{if $r\leq k$,} \\
        s &
        \text{otherwise,}
    \end{array}
    \right.
\]
where $k$ is the parameter defined in \cite[Section 5.2]{delegation_design}
which represents the desired number of stake pools.

The non-myopic pool member rewards of a pool with costs $c$, margin $m$,
pledged owner stake $s$, stake $\sigma$, rank $r$, and apparent
performance $\pbar$, for a member contributing member stake $t$, are
\[
    r_\mathrm{member, nm}(c, m, s, \sigma, t, r, \pbar) :=
    r_\mathrm{member}\Bigl(\hat{f}\bigl(s,\sigma_\mathrm{nm}(s,\sigma, r),
    \pbar\bigr),
    c, m, t, \sigma_\mathrm{nm}(s,\sigma,r)\Bigr),
\label{eq:non-myopic-member-rewards}
\]
where
\[
    r_\mathrm{member}(\hat{f}, c, m, t, \sigma) :=
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
        \displaystyle 0 &
        \text{if $\hat{f}\leq c$,} \\
        \displaystyle (\hat{f} - c)\cdot(1-m)\cdot\frac{t}{\sigma} &
        \text{otherwise.}
    \end{array}
    \right.
\]

Finally, users can use $r_\mathrm{member, nm}$ to select a pool
that maximizes their rewards.
