-- ===============================================================================
-- Generating random transactions requires splitting Values into multiple Values
-- with the same underlying amount of Coin. This property is crucial to generating
-- transactions which have the preservation of ADA property. (vsplit n v) breaks
-- v into n different values, and one remainder Coin, where the sum of the Coin
-- in the original value, and the sum of the underlying Coin in the list plus the
-- remainder coin are equal.
-- Given:    let (vs,coin) = split n value
-- Then:     (coin value) == sum(map coin vs) <+> coin

-- We introduce a new class Split which supplies this operation.
-- As new kinds of values become instances of the Val class, and we want to generate
-- transactions over these values, we will have to add additional instances here.
