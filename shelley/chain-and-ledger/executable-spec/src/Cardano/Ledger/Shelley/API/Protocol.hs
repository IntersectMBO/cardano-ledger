-- $timetravel
--
--  Time Travel (or the anachronistic ledger view)
--
--  The ledger needs to expose access to the 'LedgerView' for a window of
--  2k-slots around the current tip of the chain. This functionality allows the
--  protocol layer to validate headers without downloading corresponding blocks.
--
--  The ability to travel backwards in time is obviously always possible by
--  keeping a record of past ledger states (or, more conservatively, ledger
--  views). We do not therefore deal explicitly with it in this module, though
--  see later for discussion on when snapshots should be taken.
--
--  In order to achieve forward time travel, we need a few things:
--  - Transition rules which process the body of a block should not have any
--    effect on the @LedgerView@ for at least 2k slots after they are received.
--    This property should be guaranteed by the design of the ledger.
--  - The effect of transition rules which process the header of a block should
--    be predictable for up to 2k slots.
--
--  In Shelley, there are two transition systems which operate during header
--  processing (the BHEAD rule itself merely applying checks and delegating
--  these systems):
--  - The RUPD rule deals with creating the reward update at an appropriate
--    point.
--  - The NEWEPOCH rule deals with various updates done at the end of an epoch.
--
--  We make the following claim:
--
--  A future ledger view (within the 2k-slot bound) is either:
--  - Equal to the current ledger view (if we remain in the same epoch), or
--  - Equal to the application of the NEWEPOCH rule on the first slot of the new
--    epoch to the current ledger state, if we are in a new epoch.
--
--  A sketch proof of this claim:
--
--  We will assume, even if not stated in the below, that all
--  blocks/headers/slots are within the 2k slot window of our current slot.
--
--  Lemma 1: Let `ls` be the current state at slot `s_0`, `s` be a future slot
--  within 2k of `s_0`, and `h_s` be some valid header at slot `s`. If `epoch s
--  /= epoch s_0 + 1`, then
--
--  ```
--          h_s
--  ls ------------> ls' => view ls == view ls'
--         BHEAD
--  ```
--
--  Proof:
--
--  By the rules for NEWEPOCH, since `epoch s /= epoch s_0 + 1` the input state
--  is returned unchanged. The RUPD system modifies only the reward update
--  component of 'NewEpochState', which is thrown away by 'view'.
--
--  Lemma 2: Let `h_0, ..., h_n` be a valid set of headers continuing from
--  ledger state `ls` (that is, there is a valid transition under the BHEAD
--  system for each header). Let `h_e` be the header which first transitions to
--  a new epoch. Then:
--
--  ```
--           h_e                                       h_n
--  ls_i ------------> ls_e -----------> ls_{n-1} ------------> ls' => view ls' == view ls_e
--          BHEAD             .....                   BHEAD
--  ```
--
--  Proof: By induction on the chain, applying lemma 1.
--
--  Lemma 3: Let `h_0, h_e` be a valid set of headers continuing from ledger
--  state `ls` (that is, there is a valid transition under the BHEAD system for
--  each header). Let `h_e` be the header which first transitions to a new
--  epoch. Then given:
--
--  ```
--         h_0                h_e
--  ls ------------> ls_0 -----------> ls_e
--        BHEAD              BHEAD
--  ```
--  ```
--       slot h_e
--  ls ------------> ls'
--       NEWEPOCH
--  ```
--
--  we have that
--
--  ```
--  view ls_e == view ls'
--  ```
--
--  Proof: Since `h_e` marks the start of a new epoch (and we are within the 2k
--  window), the BHEAD transition under `h_0` must be a RUPD transition and only
--  effect that component of the state.
--
--  The NEWEPOCH rule applies that reward update by calling 'applyRUpd' before
--  the call to the EPOCH rule. By definition of 'applyRUpd', this modifies the
--  treasury and reserves in the accounting state, and the rewards and fees in
--  the ledger state.
--
--  We are then forced to proceed by component selected by 'view', chasing their
--  dependencies through the NEWEPOCH/EPOCH rules and their various subrules:
--
--  - 'lvProtParams' are determined only by the value `pp_new`, which depends
--    only on a subcomponent of `utxoSt'`, goverened by the SNAP rule. But we
--    can see that the SNAP rule does not modify the proposed new protocol
--    parameters.
--  - `lvGenDelegs` is a component of the delegation state (`dstate'`), which is
--    changed only by the POOLREAP rule. But `POOLREAP` does not modify the
--    `genDelegs` component.
--  - 'lvOverlaySched' is not part of the state updated by EPOCH, but is
--    determined according to the function  'overlaySchedule', which takes as
--    its inputs the epoch, the set of genesis keys and the protocol parameters.
--    Per our earlier analysis, the reward update does not modify the set of
--    genesis keys or the set of protocol paramters, and hence it does not
--    modify the overlay schedule.
--  - `lvPoolDistr` is not modified by the EPOCH rule, but is constructed by
--    looking at the pools (from the snapshot state) and the stake distribution,
--    which also derives entirely from the snapshots. So these are also not
--    affected by the reward update.
--
--  Lemma 4: RUPD is idempotent. For slots `s`, `s1` we have that:
--
--  ```
--          s                  s1
--  ru ------------> ru_0 -----------> ru_1 => ru_0 == ru_1
--         RUPD               RUPD
--  ```
--
--  Proof: There is only one case in the RUPD rule which modifies the state. It
--  is predicated upon the reward update being empty, and it sets it to a
--  non-empty value.
--
--  Lemma 5: For successive slots `s`, `s1` such that neither marks the
--  beginning of a new epoch, BHEAD is idempotent.
--
--  Proof: Since neither slot marks the beginning of a new epoch, in neither
--  slot does NEWEPOCH make any changes. As such both transitions only involve
--  changes from RUPD. But by lemma 4, RUPD is idempotent.
--
--  At this point, we also formalise our "time-travel" assumption in the form of
--  an axiom:
--
--  Axiom 1: Time-travelling headers. Let `b_0,...b_n` be a chain of valid
--  blocks starting at our current slot, with `h_0,...,h_n` their corresponding
--  headers. Let `cs` be our current chain state. Then given:
--
--  ```
--         b_0                                       b_n
--  cs ------------> cs_0 -----------> cs_{n-1} ------------> cs_n
--        CHAIN             .....                   CHAIN
--  ```
--  and
--  ```
--         h_0                                       h_n
--  cs ------------> hs_0 -----------> hs_{n-1} ------------> hs_n
--        BHEAD             .....                   BHEAD
--  ```
--
--  we have that
--
--  ```
--  view cs_n == view hs_n
--  ```
--
--  We may finally state the main theorem.
--
--  Theorem: Let `b_0,...b_n` be a chain of valid blocks starting at our current
--  slot, with `h_0,...,h_n` their corresponding headers. Let `cs` be our
--  current chain state. Let `b_e` be the first slot in a new epoch. Let `cs_n`
--  be as in the axiom above. Then given:
--
--  ```
--       slot b_e
--  cs ------------> ls'
--       NEWEPOCH
--  ```
--
--  we have that `view cs_n == view ls'`.
--
--  Proof: Apply axiom 1 to translate the chain of blocks into a chain of
--  headers. Apply lemma 2 on the right of the chain and lemma 5 on the left of
--  the chain. Apply lemma 3 in the middle.
