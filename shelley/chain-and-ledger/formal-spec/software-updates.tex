\section{Software Updates}
\label{sec:software-updates}

This section describes how software updates are performed.
The process of upgrading the system a new version consists of:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item New software is ready for downloading. The core nodes propose changing the
    \textit{application version}. If accepted, the proposal
    will change the application version at the start of the next epoch.
  \item All nodes see a new application version and update their software.
    Note that the new software should be compatible with the older version, and the new
    ledger rules will not be applied as long as the protocol version in the
    protocol parameters is not increased.
  \item Every block producer includes the protocol version corresponding to the software
    they are using in the blocks they produce.
  \item The core nodes monitor how many block headers contain the new protocol version.
    Once enough blocks have the new version, the core nodes post another protocol parameter
    update to increase the protocol version.
    If this proposal is accepted, it will be changed at the start of the new epoch and
    the current software then makes use of new rules.
\end{enumerate}
