\section{Cryptographic Details}
\label{sec:crypto-details}

\subsection{Hashing}
The hashing algorithm for all verification keys and multi-signature scripts is BLAKE2b-224\footnote{Note that for the signature 
and verification algorithms, as well as the proving and verification algorithms of VRFs, we use the hash function as defined in the IETF standard (see Section~\ref{sec:app-addresses}).}.
Explicitly, this is the payment and stake credentials (Figure~\ref{fig:defs:addresses}),
the genesis keys and their delegates (Figure~\ref{fig:ts-types:pp-update}),
stake pool verification keys (Figure~\ref{fig:delegation-transitions}),
and VRF verification keys (Figure~\ref{fig:delegation-defs}). 

Everywhere else we use BLAKE2b-256.
In the CDDL specification in Appendix~\ref{sec:cddl},
$\mathsf{hash28}$ refers to BLAKE2b-224 and
and $\mathsf{hash32}$ refers to BLAKE2b-256.
BLAKE2 is specified in RFC 7693 \cite{rfcBLAKE2}.

The properties that we seek out of BRAKE2b algorithm are those of a 
cryptographically safe hash function. In particular, these (informal) properties
are:
\begin{description}
\item[Preimage resistance] It should be hard to find a message with a given hash value.
\item[Second preimage resistance] Given one message, it should be hard to find another message with the same hash value.
\item[Collision resistance] It should be hard to find two messages with the same hash value. 
\end{description}

In practice, several cryptographic protocols use hash functions as random oracles. 
BLAKE2 provides indifferentiability from a random oracle. However, the properties of 
our scheme do not depend on it.  

\subsection{Addresses}
\label{sec:app-addresses}
The \fun{sign} and \fun{verify} functions from Figure~\ref{fig:crypto-defs-shelley}
use Ed25519. See \cite{rfcEdDSA}.

\subsection{KES}
The \fun{sign_{ev}} and \fun{verify_{ev}} functions from Figure~\ref{fig:kes-defs-shelley}
use the iterated sum construction from Section 3.1 of \cite{cryptoeprint:2001:034}.
We allow up to $2^7$ key evolutions, which is larger than the maximum number
of evolutions allow by the spec, \MaxKESEvo, which will be set to $90$.
See Figure~\ref{fig:rules:ocert}.

\subsection{VRF}
The \fun{verifyVrf} function from Figure~\ref{fig:defs-vrf}
uses ECVRF-ED25519-SHA512-Elligator2 as described in the draft IETF specification
\cite{rfcVRFDraft}.
