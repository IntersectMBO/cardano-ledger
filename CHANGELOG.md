If you are looking for the Ledger Releasing and Versioning Process then you can find it in
[RELEASING.md](https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-ledger/blob/master/RELEASING.md#changelogmd).


## 9.0

- Authorization of hot credentials for constitutional committee members is now only
  possible for cold credentials that are present in the ledger state, either in the current
  committee or in one of the proposals.
- Voting is restricted to entities that are present in the ledger state
- DRep votes are removed whenever DRep unregisters

## 8.12.2

- Pricing model for the size of reference scripts was changed from linear to
  exponential. Moreover, extra limits on the total size of reference scripts being used
  have been put in place.

## 8.12

- Implemented [CIP-0069](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0069)
  that improves `PlutusV3` functionality by making spending datums optional and enforcing
  all scripts to have exactly one argument.
- Ensure that `CommitteeMinSize` protocol parameter is ignored during bootstrap phase.
- Restrict types for some protocol parameters and fixup CDDL specification to reflect
  actual deserializers.
- Create pool stake distribution query for voting.
- Included rewards accounts in stake pool distribution calculation for voting.
- Bug fixes:
  - Fixes to `DRep` expiry logic and the choice of correct threshold for the committee
    voting
  - Script execution for certificates with the same plutus script did not execute correctly.
  - Prevent delegation to a non-existent pool.

## 8.11

- Prepared changes for the bootstrap period by restricting government actions and by ignoring `DRep` thresholds.
- Added the ability to do a `HardForkInitiation` into a new era.
- Added `PlutusV3` cost model to `Conway` genesis.
- Stopped counting expired committee members in active committee size calculation.
- Included rewards accounts in `DRep` distribution calculation.
- Added `AccountState` ledger state query.

- Bug fixes:
  - Stopped embedding `UTXO` and `UTXOS` predicate failures from previous eras.
  - Fixed predicate failure deserialisation bug when re-submitting a `Conway` transaction with an invalid plutus script.

## 8.10

- Retention of Anchor for proposal procedures in the ledger state in order for users to be able to query the node for those anchors
- The minimum fee calculation has been updated to take into consideration a new protocol parameter controlling the contribution of reference scripts sizes
- Redeemers serialization improvement: encode redeemers as a Map, instead of a list for Conway
- Support for intra-era hardfork initiation and necessary updates to the SPO stake distribution calculation.
- Fail translation when Conway features are present in transactions that use Plutus v1/v2
- New Conway predicate failure: `ConwayUtxosPredFailure` (to decouple Conway from `PPUP` dependency)
- Remove `small-steps-test` package and convert it into a sublibrary of `small-steps`
- Support for injecting transition configuration data in `NewEpochState`, to decouple this concern from Consensus
- Query-related changes:
  - Era-specific queries: Conway functionality supported only starting with Conway era
  - Change committee query to return non-optional `CommitteeMembersState`
  - Add optional `Anchor` to resigned status in `CommitteeMembersState`

- Important bug fixes:
  - Use the correct stake pool distribution for voting (instead of one that is an epoch too old)
  - Fix DRep stake distribution to correctly add rewards to deleged stake
  - JSON serialization of rational numbers in protocol parameters and governance procedures are encoded without loss of precision
    (`BoundedRatio` and `Prices`)
  - JSON serialization fix for `ConwayGovState`
  - Fixed the intermittent failure of Github page containing haddock documentation

## 8.8

- Full PlutusV3 support
- Support for governance policy script
- Remove the library `cardano-ledger-pretty`
- Ensure all sets are prefixed with tag 258 in CBOR serialization

- Provide accurate transaction fee estimation functionality for Haskell tools
- Important bug fixes:

  - missing `"protocolVersion"` field in JSON instance for Babbage and Conway protocol parameters
  - requiring witnesses for DRep registration
  - new committee governance action ratification was implemented incorrectly
  - guard against invalid protocol versions in hard fork initiation proposals
  - failures during updates of Plutus CostModels were not retained
  - fixed the types for some protocol parameters in order to prevent values that are too large
  - serialization and CDDL fixes for transaction witnesses in the Conway Era

## 8.7

- Fix `PParamsUpdate` governance action ratification. Votes of DReps are now accounted for.

- Add ability to retain Plutus logs for debugging when running scripts
- Adition of `ConwayGovEvent`

- Fix deserialization of `ValueNotConservedUTxO` predicate failure that could not
  previously report zero ADA.

## 8.6

- Prevent updating protocol version with PParamUpdate
- Slight performance improvements to native script handling:
  - Remove redundant script hash verification.
  - Short circuit multisig and timelock verification for `RequireMOf` as soon as necessary number of scripts have been validated.
- Check that the previous governance action of a specific type is either the very last action that has been enacted or is already in the current proposals set.
- Replace `queryCommitteeState` with more powerful `queryCommitteeMembersState`, which returns more information about committee members and supports filters based on credentials and statuses.
- Repurpose `DRepPulser` to encapsulate the Snapshots needed to run the `EPOCH` and `RATIFY` Rules. This has fixed some problem related to snapshots and behaviour at the epoch boundary.
- Add an optional anchor to committee member resignation certificate
- Prevent delegation to non-registered pools

## 8.5

- Prevent `DRep` expiry when there are no Governance Actions.
- Refreshing of expiry with votes and `UpdateTxCert`
- Disable ability to submit transactions with votes by Stake Pool Operators and
  Constitutional Committee members on Governance Actions that they should not
  be able to vote on.
- Add ability to supply initial Constitutional Committee and initial version of Constitution.
- Preserve order of submitted ProposalProcedures and account for their priority.
- Disallow empty fields in CBOR of Conway TxBody
- Add some sanity checks for `UpdateCommittee` proposals and change semantics of the
  proposal from overwrite to modify the Committee
- Implement Constitutional Committee expiration, validation and modification
- Respect Constitutional Committee members votes and thresholds during ratification
- Whenever Constitutional Committee size goes below `CommitteeMinSize` parameter the whole
  committee will vote `No` on all proposals.
- Restructure initial configuration in such a way that makes it possible for Conway era to
  start without going through all previous eras, which is needed for testing and
  benchmarking.
- Apply ADA treasury transfers after enactment of `TreasuryWithdrawals` proposals
- Enforce `currentTreasuryValue` field in the TxBody matches the actual Treasury amount,
  whenver the field is supplied

## 8.4

- `GovernanceProposals` functionality:
  - Implement expiry
  - Enforce the supplied deposit amount
  - Enforce previous GovActionId is correct
- Enforce deposits and ensure refunds for `DRep`s. This affects transaction building functionality.
- Enforce thresholds for votes from PParams for Stake Pool Operators and DReps
- Delaying of ratification after `NoConfidence`, `HardForkInitiation`, `NewCommittee`,
  `NewConstitution` actions have been enacted.

## 8.3

  - Implement `DRep` voting and use actual `DRep` stake distribution for ratification
  - Implement `DRep` expiry for stale DRep's
  - Add `DRep` deposit tracking.
  - Add `Anchor`s for `DRep`s
- Fix `ProposalProcedure` deposit tracking.
- Add ability to upgrade core types from one era to the next.
- Add `Script` capability to Constitutional Committee Hot and Cold credentials.
- Add `NetworkId` validation for `ProposalProcedure` and `TreasuryWithdrawals`

- Voting thresholds have been added to `PParams`

## 8.2

- Restructure certificate interface
- Conway related changes:
  - Introduction of a `DRep` with the defaults that vote No and Abstain.
  - Change `DCert` type to a `TxCert` type family and introduce new certificates
  - Implement voting on `NewConstitution` by StakePools as the most basic example of voting.
  - Implement query for getting `Constitution` hash from the ledger state.
  - Change structure of Governance Procedures in the TxBody
  - Fix `TICKF` rule, avoiding VRF verification and syncing issues
  - Clear out TxOuts with zero value from the UTxO upon translation into Conway

## 8.1

- Plutus V3 support, only available in the conway ledger era.
- `PState` is now parametric in era, not crypto.
- Adjust for new conway era certificates.
- Ledger `UMapCompact` is now `UMap`
- Ledger types with names involving `DState` are renamed to `CertState`.

## 8.0

- The provenance for the reward calculation has been removed. The type signature to the API function `getRewardProvenance` has not changed, it just returns an empty provenance value.
- We have created a Ledger API, with the aim of providing a user-friendly interface to the ledger libraries. See [here](https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-ledger/tree/b00e28698d9c7fbbeda1c9cfdd1238d3bc4569cf/libs/cardano-ledger-api).
- The initial funds and staking in the Shelley genesis type (used only for testing) now use `ListMap` instead of `Map`.
- There is a new `calculatePoolDistr'` function which is similar to `calculatePoolDistr` but has a new filter argument to only include the stake pool ids (stake pool key hashes) that are needed.
- The ledger events are not guaranteed to appear in any given order within a block. For this reason, motivated by the use case in db-sync, the `TotalDeposits` event now includes a transaction ID and emits the change in deposits instead of the value.
- We changed the way deposits are tracked. See [here](https://github.com/intersectmbo/cardano-ledger/blob/b00e28698d9c7fbbeda1c9cfdd1238d3bc4569cf/docs/adr/2022-12-05_003-track-individual-deposits.md) for the details.
- We changed the API function Cardano.Ledger.Shelley.API.Wallet(`evaluateTransactionBalance`) to take `DPState` as input. This can no longer be computed without the `DPState`
- Some noticeable changes have been made which will only become apparent starting at major protocol version 9:
  - There is a new ledger era, namely `conway`.
  - We now have the ability to more easily change serializations when the major protocol version changes. Though this change is not immediately visible to the node, it enables visible changes in the future. See [CIP-80](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/tree/master/CIP-0080) For the deprecation cycle.
  - Pointer addresses will no longer accrue rewards starting with version 9.
  - We fixed the incorrect conversion of the validity interval's upper bound in `transVITime`.
  - Starting in version 9, duplicate keys in CBOR maps and sets are no longer allowed.
  - Starting in version 9, `CostModel`s can now be deserialized from any map of Word8 values to lists of integers. Only valid cost models are actually converted to evaluation contexts that can be used. Errors and unrecognized language versions are stored in the `CostModel` type so that:
      - They can accept cost models that they do not yet understand.
      - Upon deserializing after a software update, new cost models are available from the prior serialization.

  #2888

## Release tag `ledger/1.0.0`

The first release branch in the cardano-ledger repository,
namely `release/1.0.0`, branches from the
cardano-ledger commit used for the 1.35.0 release of cardano-node release.

### Fixed

- Ensure Babbage TxOut decoder can't fail due to malformed Ptr.
  This bug was manifesting in the cardano-node as:
  if a node is running in the Babbage era and shuts down, when it comes back up it has to re-sync from genesis.
  #2897
- The Alonzo UTxO rule was previously using the incorrect minfee function (from Shelley).
  It now uses the Alonze minfee function.
  #2936
